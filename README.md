 A simple male micro usb breakout  

 I designed these to plug into a micro controller so that you can easily connect the data lines to a dedicated USB port.   

If you're not sure how to get these manufactured check out this repository, https://github.com/HTangl/Model-U.  
There's a short guide there on how to order SMT part assembly from JLCPCB.
