# MMU Breakout
 A simple male micro usb breakout  

 I designed these to plug into an arduino so that I could connect the data lines to a dedicated USB port.  

 You can use them for whatever you want, panelized files are in the "Fabrication Files" folder.  

If you're not sure how to get these manufactured check out this repository, https://github.com/HTangl/Model-U.  
There's a short guide there on how to order SMT part assembly from JLCPCB.
